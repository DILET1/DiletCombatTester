# DiletCombatTester
A Combat tester for the mechanics of a game I'm working on. Uses Java and processing 3.5.3. 
Controls: Dilet is WASD and Z to attack, Telid is IJKL and M to attack. Two hits to win.
Graphics: Made with Piskel. 

Note: project abandoned due to it being clunky af. Time to move on to unity. 
Note 2: No one has ever seen this i swear if you do report an issue
Note 3: COde is being re-activated for a top-down exploration game, stay tuned!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (OR DON'T, YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE GO AWAY!)
